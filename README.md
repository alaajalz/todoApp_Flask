After three years of working with Django, today I decided to explore its counterpart, Flask. 
In this app, I try out a basic ToDo App using CRUD operations.

Both Django and Flask are Python frameworks for web development, but they have different approaches and philosophies. 
Django offers a comprehensive solution with built-in features like authentication and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), while Flask provides a minimalist, flexible framework.

Django is great for rapid development and large-scale projects, whereas Flask shines in projects that require customization and control. 
Exploring Flask will broaden my understanding of Python web development beyond Django's boundaries.
